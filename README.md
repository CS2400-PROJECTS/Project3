Ana Venegas

Ana's Contribution:
Tasks 1: Added methods for postorderTraverse into BinaryTree.java and BinaryNode.java
Task  2: Added getHeight_binaryNodeMethod() to the BinaryNode.java
Task  4: Created tree 2, and tested the code to make sure all the methods implemented are working.

Note: At the end of the video I show that the the code is working, and display the right order, height and number of nodes.
